    "### Assighnment 2:Theory of zero \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ancient India**:\n",
    "   - The concept of zero as a number was fully developed in ancient India. It was used in mathematics and astronomy, with the earliest recorded use of zero found in the Bakhshali Manuscript, which dates back to around the 3rd or 4th century CE.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Islamic Golden Age**:\n",
    "   - Scholars in the Islamic Golden Age, such as Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Kindi, played a significant role in preserving and disseminating the concept of zero and the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Medieval Europe**:\n",
    "   - The concept of zero reached Europe through translations of Arabic texts during the Middle Ages. Fibonacci's \"Liber Abaci\" was instrumental in introducing the use of zero and the decimal system to European mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The history of zero is a story of gradual development and transmission across cultures. While the Babylonians used a placeholder concept, it was in ancient India that zero was first conceptualized as a number with its own properties. Indian mathematicians like Brahmagupta formalized its use in arithmetic operations. This knowledge was then passed through the Islamic scholars to medieval Europe, where it became integral to the modern number system."
