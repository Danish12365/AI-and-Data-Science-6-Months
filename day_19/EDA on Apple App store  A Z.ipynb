    "# Assighnment # 1: Enlist the magic commands for python with functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic commands in Python are special commands provided by IPython (Interactive Python) that allow you to perform a variety of tasks, such as timing code execution, debugging, loading external files, and more. Here are some commonly used magic commands along with their functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `%matplotlib inline`: This magic command enables inline plotting, which means that the output of plotting commands is displayed directly below the code cell that produced it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `%time` or `%%time`: This magic command is used to measure the execution time of a single statement or an entire cell, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `%timeit` or `%%timeit`: This magic command is used to measure the average execution time of a single statement or an entire cell over multiple runs, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `%run`: This magic command is used to run a Python script file (.py) or a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) as if it were imported as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `%load`: This magic command is used to load the contents of an external Python script into the current code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `%store`: This magic command is used to store variables from the current Jupyter notebook session to a file, so they can be accessed in future sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `%reset`: This magic command is used to reset the namespace by clearing all variables, functions, and imported modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `%debug`: This magic command is used to enter the interactive debugger at the point where an exception occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `%alias`: This magic command is used to create custom aliases for existing commands or code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `%history`: This magic command is used to display the command history, optionally filtered by search criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `%magic` or `%quickref`: These magic commands are used to display a list of available magic commands and their usage documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of magic commands in Python. There are many more available, each serving a specific purpose to enhance your interactive Python experience in Jupyter notebooks or IPython shells."

    "# Assighnment #2: How many ways are there to formate a strings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to format strings in Python, each with its own advantages and use cases. Here are the most common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using the `%` operator (f-string formatting - Python 3.6+):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   This method, introduced in Python 3.6, is considered the most readable and versatile way to format strings. You place placeholders (`{}`) within the string and use an f-string literal (prefixed with `f`) to insert variable values or expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "   age = 30\n",
    "   greeting = f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\"\n",
    "   print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. String formatting method (`format()` method):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   This method allows you to insert values or expressions at specific positions within a string using positional or named placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"Bob\"\n",
    "   price = 19.99\n",
    "   formatted_text = \"Hi {}! The price is ${:.2f}\".format(name, price)\n",
    "   print(formatted_text)  # Output: Hi Bob! The price is $19.99\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Positional arguments (`{}`) are filled in the order they appear.\n",
    "   * Named arguments (`{name}` or `name={value}`) provide more clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Using string methods (e.g., `.join()`, `.center()`, `.upper()`, `.lower()`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Python strings offer various methods for manipulating and formatting their content. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `.join(iterable)`: Joins elements of an iterable (like a list) into a string with a specified separator.\n",
    "   - `.center(width, fillchar)`: Centers the string within a specified width, padding with a fill character (space by default).\n",
    "   - `.upper()`: Converts the string to uppercase.\n",
    "   - `.lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Right Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For simple formatting with a few variables, f-strings are generally preferred for readability.\n",
    "- For more complex formatting or compatibility with older Python versions, the `format()` method is an option.\n",
    "- String methods provide targeted manipulation of string content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the best approach depends on the specific formatting task and your coding preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# There are several ways to format strings in Python: ByCHAT GPT\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using the `%` Operator**: This is known as the old-style string formatting method, where placeholders in the string are replaced by values from a tuple using the `%` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    name = \"John\"\n",
    "    age = 30\n",
    "    formatted_string = \"My name is %s and I am %d years old.\" % (name, age)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using the `str.format()` Method**: This method provides more flexibility and readability compared to the `%` operator. Placeholders are defined within curly braces `{}` and replaced with values passed as arguments to the `format()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    name = \"John\"\n",
    "    age = 30\n",
    "    formatted_string = \"My name is {} and I am {} years old.\".format(name, age)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using f-Strings (Formatted String Literals)**: Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings allow embedding Python expressions directly within string literals. They are denoted by an `f` or `F` prefix before the opening quote of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    name = \"John\"\n",
    "    age = 30\n",
    "    formatted_string = f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using the `str.join()` Method**: This method concatenates elements of an iterable with a separator string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    name = \"John\"\n",
    "    age = 30\n",
    "    formatted_string = \" \".join([\"My name is\", name, \"and I am\", str(age), \"years old.\"])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using Template Strings**: This module provides a simple and safe way to perform string substitutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from string import Template\n",
    "    \n",
    "    name = \"John\"\n",
    "    age = 30\n",
    "    template = Template(\"My name is $name and I am $age years old.\")\n",
    "    formatted_string = template.substitute(name=name, age=age)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods has its advantages and use cases, so choose the one that best fits your requirements and coding style."
