    "Dealing with missing values is a common and important part of the data preprocessing stage in machine learning and data analysis. In Python, missing values are usually represented as `NaN` (Not a Number). The `pandas` library offers robust tools to handle these missing values. Here’s a detailed guide to handling missing values step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Identifying Missing Values**\n",
    "Before dealing with missing values, the first step is to **identify** them in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Dataset:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample dataset\n",
    "data = {'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Emma', None],\n",
    "        'Age': [28, None, 34, 29, 30],\n",
    "        'Salary': [50000, 60000, None, None, 55000]}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "     Name   Age   Salary\n",
    "0    John  28.0  50000.0\n",
    "1   Alice   NaN  60000.0\n",
    "2     Bob  34.0      NaN\n",
    "3    Emma  29.0      NaN\n",
    "4    None  30.0  55000.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above dataset:\n",
    "- The **`Name`** column has a missing value (`None`).\n",
    "- The **`Age`** column has one missing value (`NaN`).\n",
    "- The **`Salary`** column has two missing values (`NaN`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1.1: Check for Missing Values\n",
    "To check for missing values, you can use the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check for missing values in the entire DataFrame\n",
    "print(df.isnull())   # True means the value is missing\n",
    "\n",
    "# Count the number of missing values in each column\n",
    "print(df.isnull().sum())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    Name    Age  Salary\n",
    "0  False  False  False\n",
    "1  False   True  False\n",
    "2  False  False   True\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Dealing with Missing Values**\n",
    "Once you’ve identified where the missing values are, you can handle them using different techniques based on the problem and data type. The main approaches include **removing** missing values, **imputing** missing values, and **replacing** missing values.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 **Removing Missing Values**\n",
    "This approach is useful when the proportion of missing data is small and removing the records won’t significantly affect the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2.1.1: Drop Rows with Missing Values\n",
    "To remove rows that contain any missing value:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Drop rows with any missing values\n",
    "df_dropped_rows = df.dropna()\n",
    "print(df_dropped_rows)\n",

    "```\n",
    "Here, all rows with missing values were removed, leaving only the first row.\n",

    "#### Step 2.1.2: Drop Columns with Missing Values\n",
    "To remove columns that contain any missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Drop columns with any missing values\n",
    "df_dropped_columns = df.dropna(axis=1)\n",

    "4    None\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, it removed both the `Age` and `Salary` columns, as they contain missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2.1.3: Drop Rows or Columns Based on a Threshold\n",
    "You may want to drop rows or columns that have more than a certain number of missing values. For example, you might remove rows that have more than 1 missing value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Drop rows with more than 1 missing value\n",
    "df_dropped_thresh = df.dropna(thresh=2)\n",
    "print(df_dropped_thresh)\n",

    "1   Alice   NaN  60000.0\n",
    "2     Bob  34.0      NaN\n",
    "4    None  30.0  55000.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, only row 3 (Emma) was dropped because it had more than 1 missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 **Imputing Missing Values**\n",
    "Imputation is the process of replacing missing values with estimates based on the existing data. This is often preferred over removing data, as it prevents the loss of valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2.2.1: Fill Missing Values with a Constant (Zero, Mean, Median, Mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Filling with a Constant Value**:\n",

    "##### **Filling with the Mean (for numerical data)**:\n",
    "You can replace missing values in a column with the mean of that column.\n",

    "##### **Filling with the Median (for skewed distributions)**:\n",
    "You can also replace missing values with the median:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df_filled_median = df.copy()\n",
    "df_filled_median['Age'] = df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median())\n",
    "df_filled_median['Salary'] = df['Salary'].fillna(df['Salary'].median())\n",
    "print(df_filled_median)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Filling with the Mode (for categorical data)**:\n",
    "For categorical columns, replacing missing values with the mode (most frequent value) makes sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Fill missing 'Name' with the most frequent value (mode)\n",

    "The best method to deal with missing values depends on several factors related to the nature of the data, the proportion of missing values, and the context of the analysis. Here are some considerations for choosing the best method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Small Percentage of Missing Values**\n",
    "If only a small proportion of your data has missing values, and the data is not crucial for your analysis, you can simply **drop rows or columns** with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When to Use:** When missing values are less than 5% of the dataset.\n",
    "- **Method:** `df.dropna()` or dropping specific columns/rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df_cleaned = df.dropna()  # Remove rows with any missing values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Larger Percentage of Missing Values (Imputation Required)**\n",
    "If a significant portion of your dataset has missing values, **imputation** is the preferred method. There are various imputation techniques based on the type of data you’re working with:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Numerical Data (Continuous)**:\n",
    "- **Mean/Median Imputation**: \n",
    "  - **Mean** is used if the data is normally distributed.\n",
    "  - **Median** is better for data with outliers or skewed distributions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df['Age'] = df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].mean())  # Mean Imputation\n",
    "  df['Salary'] = df['Salary'].fillna(df['Salary'].median())  # Median Imputation\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Categorical Data**:\n",
    "- **Mode Imputation**: Replace missing values with the most frequent category (mode). This works well for columns with a small number of distinct categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df['Category'] = df['Category'].fillna(df['Category'].mode()[0])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Time-Series Data**\n",
    "For time-series data, **forward fill** or **backward fill** are commonly used, as they propagate the last observed value forward or backward to fill in missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When to Use:** When the data points are dependent on each other over time.\n",

    "For more sophisticated datasets, particularly when missing values appear in patterns, **advanced imputation methods** like KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) or regression-based imputation are effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: This technique works by filling missing values based on the nearest observations in terms of distance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **When to Use:** When the relationship between missing values and other features is complex.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)**: This method iteratively predicts missing values using multiple regression models.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **When to Use:** For complex datasets where each feature can be predicted by other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Best Methods Based on Scenarios:\n",
    "1. **Small Missing Data (Less than 5%)**: Drop rows/columns.\n",
    "2. **Numerical Data**: Use **mean** for normal distributions and **median** for skewed distributions.\n",
    "3. **Categorical Data**: Use **mode** to fill missing categorical values.\n",
    "4. **Time-Series Data**: Use **forward fill** or **backward fill**.\n",
