    "Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers involves different methods, including the use of prime factorization, the Euclidean algorithm for GCD, and the relationship between GCD and LCM. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Finding the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1: Prime Factorization**\n",
    "1. **Prime Factorize Both Numbers**: Write each number as a product of prime factors.\n",
    "2. **Identify Common Factors**: Determine the common prime factors.\n",
    "3. **Choose the Lowest Power of Each Common Prime Factor**: Multiply these together to get the GCD.\n",

    "# Explain the modules in depth and how we find a mod of different number \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Modular arithmetic, often referred to as \"clock arithmetic,\" involves computations where numbers wrap around upon reaching a certain value called the modulus. It focuses on the remainders of integer division.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modulus (n)**:\n",
    "   - The fixed number at which we wrap around in modular arithmetic.\n",
    "   - Notation: \\( a \\mod n \\) represents the remainder when \\( a \\) is divided by \\( n \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Congruence**:\n",
    "   - If two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) have the same remainder when divided by \\( n \\), they are said to be congruent modulo \\( n \\).\n",
    "   - Notation: \\( a \\equiv b \\mod n \\).\n",
    "   - Example: \\( 17 \\equiv 5 \\mod 12 \\) because both 17 and 5 leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Modulus\n",
    "\n",
    "To find \\( a \\mod n \\):\n",
    "1. **Divide \\( a \\) by \\( n \\)** and determine the quotient.\n",
    "2. **Multiply** the quotient by \\( n \\).\n",
    "3. **Subtract** this product from \\( a \\). The remainder is \\( a \\mod n \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, simply use the remainder of the division of \\( a \\) by \\( n \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**: Finding \\( 17 \\mod 5 \\)\n",
    "1. Divide \\( 17 \\) by \\( 5 \\):\n",
    "   - Quotient: \\( 3 \\) (since \\( 17 \\div 5 = 3.4 \\))\n",
    "   - Product of quotient and divisor: \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n",
    "2. Subtract \\( 15 \\) from \\( 17 \\):\n",
    "   - \\( 17 - 15 = 2 \\)\n",
    "3. Thus, \\( 17 \\mod 5 = 2 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2**: Finding \\( 100 \\mod 12 \\)\n",
    "1. Divide \\( 100 \\) by \\( 12 \\):\n",
    "   - Quotient: \\( 8 \\) (since \\( 100 \\div 12 = 8.3333 \\))\n",
    "   - Product of quotient and divisor: \\( 8 \\times 12 = 96 \\)\n",
    "2. Subtract \\( 96 \\) from \\( 100 \\):\n",
    "   - \\( 100 - 96 = 4 \\)\n",
    "3. Thus, \\( 100 \\mod 12 = 4 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addition**:\n",
    "   - \\( (a + b) \\mod n = [(a \\mod n) + (b \\mod n)] \\mod n \\)\n",
    "   - Example: \\( (7 + 10) \\mod 5 = (2 + 0) \\mod 5 = 2 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subtraction**:\n",
    "   - \\( (a - b) \\mod n = [(a \\mod n) - (b \\mod n)] \\mod n \\)\n",
    "   - Example: \\( (7 - 10) \\mod 5 = (2 - 0) \\mod 5 = 2 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiplication**:\n",
    "   - \\( (a \\times b) \\mod n = [(a \\mod n) \\times (b \\mod n)] \\mod n \\)\n",
    "   - Example: \\( (7 \\times 10) \\mod 5 = (2 \\times 0) \\mod 5 = 0 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exponentiation**:\n",
    "   - \\( (a^b) \\mod n \\) can be computed using successive squaring and reduction modulo \\( n \\) at each step to keep numbers manageable.\n",
    "   - Example: \\( 3^4 \\mod 5 \\):\n",
    "     - \\( 3^4 = 81 \\)\n",
    "     - \\( 81 \\mod 5 = 1 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cryptography**: Widely used in algorithms like RSA, where operations are performed modulo a large prime number.\n",
    "2. **Computer Science**: Hash functions, checksums, and cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) often use modular arithmetic.\n",
    "3. **Number Theory**: Used in solving congruences and exploring properties of integers.\n",
    "4. **Calendar Calculations**: Determining the day of the week for a given date often uses modular arithmetic.\n",
    "5. **Digital Signal Processing**: Applied in algorithms for processing digital signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example: The Chinese Remainder Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if one knows the remainders of the division of an integer \\( x \\) by several pairwise coprime integers, one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of \\( x \\) by the product of these integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Find \\( x \\) such that:\n",
    "- \\( x \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\)\n",
    "- \\( x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n",
    "- \\( x \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "1. Find a number that satisfies all these congruences. Let's denote the product of moduli as \\( N = 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60 \\).\n",
    "2. Solve each congruence individually to find a common solution. For this simple example, testing values:\n",
    "   - \\( x = 11 \\) works because:\n",
    "     - \\( 11 \\mod 3 = 2 \\)\n",
    "     - \\( 11 \\mod 4 = 3 \\)\n",
    "     - \\( 11 \\mod 5 = 1 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, \\( x = 11 \\) is a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic provides a powerful and efficient way to handle problems involving cyclic and periodic phenomena, making it indispensable in various fields of mathematics and its applications."
