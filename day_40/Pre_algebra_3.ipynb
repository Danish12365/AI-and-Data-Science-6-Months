    "# Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the event will not occur and 1 indicates certainty that the event will occur. Here’s a brief overview of the key concepts in probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment**: An action or process that leads to one or several outcomes. For example, rolling a die.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment. For example, getting a 4 when rolling a die.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event**: A set of one or more outcomes. For example, getting an even number when rolling a die (which includes 2, 4, and 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sample Space (\\(S\\))**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For a six-sided die, the sample space is \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Probability of an Event (\\(P(E)\\))**: The likelihood of the event \\( E \\) occurring. It is calculated by:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Theoretical Probability**: Based on reasoning and the nature of the experiment. For example, the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die is:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(\\text{rolling a 3}) = \\frac{1}{6}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Experimental Probability**: Based on actual experiments and observations. It is calculated by:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times event E occurs}}{\\text{Total number of trials}}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subjective Probability**: Based on intuition, experience, or judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Rules and Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complement Rule**: The probability of the complement of an event \\( E \\) (not \\( E \\)) is:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(\\text{not } E) = 1 - P(E)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Addition Rule**: For any two events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\text{ and } B)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   If \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen at the same time):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiplication Rule**: For any two independent events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Event**: What is the probability of drawing an ace from a standard deck of 52 cards?\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(\\text{ace}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Events**: What is the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 on a six-sided die?\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(\\text{3 or 5}) = P(\\text{3}) + P(\\text{5}) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complementary Events**: What is the probability of not rolling a 6 on a six-sided die?\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(\\text{not 6}) = 1 - P(\\text{6}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these basic concepts and rules can help you solve a wide range of probability problems."
